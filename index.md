## Project Proposal 

### Unsupervised Machine Learning to Investigate Cardiovascular Disease

#### Introduction and Background
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Development of cardiovascular disease has been correlated with risk factors including obesity, high cholesterol, and hypertension [1]. Most of these risk factors are preventable with proper patient education.

#### Problem Definition
Identifying specific clinical sub-populations of patients with cardiovascular disease can help researchers develop more personalized treatments and help doctors better predict specific types of patients that will be at risk for developing heart disease.

#### Data Collection

#### Methods
Unsupervised machine learning techniques offer a solution for organizing patients into sub-populations based on their medical history. A previous study has proven clustering algorithms to be successful in identifying clinical sub-populations of Alzheimer’s disease patients [2]. A similar exploratory method will be applied to study patients with cardiovascular disease. T-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and Principal Component Analysis will be applied to produce independent dimensionally-reduced versions of the original dataset. K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms will then be separably applied to the original dataset and the reduced dimensionality versions of the dataset. The analysis which produces the most separable clusters will be selected for further statistical analysis to determine the characterizing features of each cluster.

#### Results and Discussion
The discovered clinical sub-populations will be presented along with their characterizing features. A review of medical literature will be conducted to contextualize these results with previous findings concerning cardiac disease.

### Supervised Machine Learning to Detect and Classify Anti-Vaccine Tweets 

#### Introduction/Background
The ongoing pandemic has yielded not only various vaccines, but also a plethora of anti-vaccination messages and posts all over the internet. The prevalence of anti-vaccine content has propagated a spread of health information across social media platforms. The spreading of false anti-vaccine information on a large scale has the potential to put human lives at risk. 

#### Problem Fefinition: 
Autonomously detecting tweets with anti-vaccine content can help authorities efficiently find published messages on Twitter that may be spreading incorrect false information about vaccines.

#### Data Collection

#### Methods:
Previous work has proven that supervised machine learning methods are a viable solution for detecting anti-vaccine tweets [3]. Similar methods will be utilized to train a classifier to detect anti-vaccine tweets based upon the Avax Tweet dataset [4]. Normalization techniques including transforming text to lowercase, removing unneeded characters, and lemmatization will be applied to prepare the dataset for processing. The preprocessed data will be partitioned into separate datasets for training and testing purposes. A Support Vector Machine model and a Naive Bayes model will be independently tested as the classifier for the project. The performance of each classifier will be analyzed by considering metrics such as F1 scores.

#### Results and Discussion: 
The performance metrics for each model will be presented and compared with previous studies [3] to determine the efficacy of each model.
